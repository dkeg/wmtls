####  Scripts currently using with wm-utils. 
##### From wmutils/contrib, wmutils/opt, z3bra/scripts, Chef
- Thank you to the authors
- I have made some minor changes to suit my needs, 
- Source current xcolors for borders
- Padding to corners
- Includes my current sxhkdrc
- middles is a cool little script by ChefIronBelly

#### Changed a few things for an overall cleaner appeal
- fcs = focus.sh 
- clst = closest.sh 
  * like an alt-tab; allows moving focus b/t windows
- grps = groups.sh
- sgrd = switch_grid.sh
- fw = focus_watcher.sh
  * focus newly spawned window, focus next when window in focus closed
- corner
  * padding 
- maximize -> max
  * like cwm and 2bwm. Max vertically, horizontally, or fullscreen. Thannks z3bra!
  * added maximize (slight gap all around) like cwm

#### I have also made a few modifications
- fcs sources xcolors for active and inactive borders
